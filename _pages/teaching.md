### *"Giovanni was absolutely incredible! It became clear very early in the quarter how much knowledge Giovanni had regarding the different demographics we studied, and I really enjoyed him providing a unique perspective each week during section. He was extremely responsive with emails and communicated well regarding assignments, grading, or changes with the course. Overall, Giovanni was amazing, and was really resonated with me was how well he understood the course material, and was able to lead a very informative and analytical discussion every week."*

### *"I thought Giovanni was very intelligent and knowledgeable about the course material. He had an answer to every question presented in the discussion sections and provided extra information for us to have all of the time. I enjoyed having him as a T.A. and feel his sections helped benefit me in the course. I don't feel there were any weaknesses in his teaching and I would take a lecture he taught if given the opportunity."*

### *"He genuinely wants students to understand the material. He will stay with the student for as long as is needed for them to understand the material. He demonstrated thorough knowledge of the course itself and simplified the course concepts for students to be able to understand."*
